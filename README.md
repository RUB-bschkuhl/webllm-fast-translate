# WebLLM Translation Chrome Extension

A privacy-focused Chrome extension that provides AI-powered translation between Persian (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å), English, and German using WebLLM technology - all running locally in your browser.

## What is WebLLM?

[WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) is a cutting-edge technology that brings large language models (LLMs) directly to web browsers. Instead of sending your data to external servers, WebLLM runs AI models like Llama and Phi locally using:

- **WebGPU**: Leverages your device's GPU for fast inference
- **WebAssembly**: Efficient execution of AI models in browsers  
- **Local Processing**: Zero data leaves your device - complete privacy

## Features

- üîí **100% Private**: All translation happens locally, no data sent to servers
- üåç **Multi-language**: Persian (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å), English, and German translation
- üß† **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects input language
- üìù **Context-Aware**: Provides example sentences for single-word translations
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Optimized models for quick translation (1-3GB cache after first download)
- üéØ **Offline Ready**: Works without internet after initial model download

## Persian Translation Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current Limitation**: Full Persian translation capability requires specialized models with robust Persian language support. The currently available WebLLM models (Llama 3.2, Phi 3.5) have limited Persian capabilities, which may result in inconsistent translation quality for Persian text.

**Future Development**: We are actively working on integrating Persian-optimized models into the WebLLM ecosystem to provide high-quality Persian translations. This will significantly improve the accuracy and fluency of Persian ‚Üî English and Persian ‚Üî German translations.

## How It Works

1. **First Use**: Download and cache an AI model (Llama 3.2 1B or Phi 3.5 Mini)
2. **Translation**: Enter text in any supported language
3. **AI Processing**: WebLLM detects language and translates locally
4. **Results**: Get translations to the other two languages instantly

## Quick Start

```bash
cd my-chrome-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

Then load the `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome Developer Mode.
